# LEOVIM
This is my personal Neovim configuration. This would have typically lived inside my dotfiles repository, but after being too optimistic about all the fancy stuff I wanted to implement, I had to make it its own repo.

If you came across this, chances are you know me in person and wanted to try my configuration. In the spirit of easily sharing this, I made this repo public.
