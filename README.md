# LEOVIM
This is my Neovim configuration. This would have typically lived inside my dotfiles repository, but after being too optimistic about all the fancy stuff I wanted to implement, I had to make it its own repo.

If you came across this, chances are you know me in person and wanted to try my configuration. In the spirit of easily sharing this, I made this repo public.

## Features

* Simplicity
* Preconfigured LaTeX support

## Quick Start


### Installation

Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/leogabac/leovim.git ~/.config/nvim
```
and launch
```bash
nvim
```
