# LEOVIM Documentation

> Not even my thesis' codes have this sort of documentation.

LEOVIM is yet another Neovim configuration. At first I made it for myself when I wanted to heavily modify the behavior of my Neovim distribution at the time, after changing too much, I decided to make my own configuration.

This is NOT a neovim distribution, but a template that you can use ,tasks, modify, and make your own. In fact, I encourage you to keep this config simultaneously with your own. To do this, go to the [FAQ](./faq.md) section.

This template comes preconfigured with many of the tools I use daily, those include.

* LSP for common languages
* Tmux
* LaTeX
* Markdown (I am working to have an Obsidian replacement)

Here is a quick table on where to go when you are lost, and hopefully all your questions will be answered.

* [Table of Plugins](./latex.md) 
* [Keymaps](./keymaps.md) 
* [LaTeX Setup](./latex.md) 
* [Frequently Asked Questions](./faq.md)
