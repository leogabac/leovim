At first I made it for myself when I wanted to heavily modify the behavior of my Neovim distribution at the time, after changing too much, I decided to make my own configuration. This is not a neovim distribution, but a template that you can use, modify, and make your own. In fact, I encourage you to keep and use this configuration along your own. To do this, go to the FAQ section. ",
